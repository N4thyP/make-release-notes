[Scala 2.13.0-M1](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.0-M1) prepares for the next phase of the standard library [modularization](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/323) and the [collections rework](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman).
The parallel collections are now a separate [module](https://github.com/scala/scala-parallel-collections), and many deprecated members have been removed.
As a reminder, our [full 2.13 roadmap](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/324) is available for review on GitHub.
