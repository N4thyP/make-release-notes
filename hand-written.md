## Changes

Our [benchmarks](https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/grafana/dashboard/db/scala-benchmark?var-branch=2.12.x&from=1501580691158&to=1507711932006) show a further reduction in compile times since 2.12.3 of 5-10%.

We'd like to highlight a few of the excellent contributions by @hrhino and @TomasMikula:
  - #5867 Include the parts of a compound/refinement type in implicit scope
  - #6074 Resolve implicit instances for abstract types, according to the spec
  - #6069 Higher-kinded type variable unification

Improved jdk9 friendliness, with more to come!
  - #6097 Fix runtime reflection of empty package members under Java 9
  - #6098 Adapt to change in Java 9 classloader hierarchy

For Spark, with love:
  - #6101 Make Lazy* classes serializable 

Note that named arguments will be simplified in 2.13:
  - #6089 Deprecate assignments in argument position

Rather than pollute `/tmp`,
  - #6120 Move compilation daemon portfile under `~/.scalac/`

For more details, check out [all closed bugs](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2.12.4) and [merged PRs](https://github.com/scala/scala/pulls?q=is%3Amerged%20milestone%3A2.12.4).

As usual for minor releases, Scala 2.12.4 is binary compatible with the whole Scala 2.12 series.
